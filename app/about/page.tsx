              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                I've sent out 500+ applications and gotten 3 interviews, 0 offers. For the longest time I thought something was wrong with me.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Then I started talking to people and realized... wait, is everyone going through this?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                So I made a quick anonymous survey to actually figure out what's normal. How many applications are people really sending?
                What are response rates looking like? When are people actually getting offers?
